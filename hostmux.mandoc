.Sh DESCRIPTION
Call hostmux followed by a list of hosts you want to connect to via ssh.
The script will create a new tmux session with a split pane for each
specified host and connect to it.
.Pp
You can then use the synchronize-panes feature of tmux to
multiplex/broadcast commands to all split panes / servers (see -a).
.Pp
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar session-name
Specify a name for the tmux session. It defaults to 'hostmux' which means that
you can have only one hostmux session at a time if you don't specify unique
names for your sessions
.It Fl l Ar tmux-layout
Specify a valid tmux layout e.g. even-horizontal, tiled, etc. It defaults to
\'even-vertical\'
.It Fl f Ar hostfile
Specify a file which contains a newline separated list of [user@]host names. The
hosts from the file will be merged with the hosts provided as optional arguments
.It Fl C Ar remote-command
Specify a command that should be run on all the machines prior to opening a shell
.It Fl x
Close the pane and/or session automatically when the ssh session
exits successfully
.It Fl p
Identify panes by setting the pane title to the ssh hostname (tmux >= 2.3), may
not work if the remote host does $PS1 magic like setting the terminal title,
in that case use
.Fl P
.It Fl P
Identify panes by setting the remote prompt $PS1 to "[<hostname>]$ " after
login
.It Fl a
Synchronize all panes, i.e. type commands simultaneously in all panes
.It Fl h
Display usage information
.It Ar host
Specify a space separated list of one or more user@hostname ssh targets. This
is what you would pass to the ssh command when you are connecting
to a host. Currently there is no support for passing additional flags
to ssh. If you do need them, add them to your ~/.ssh/config
